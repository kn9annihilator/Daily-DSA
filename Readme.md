# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my daily practice and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

### Purpose
The main objective of maintaining this repository is to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills through consistent practice
- Prepare for coding rounds in technical interviews and placements
- Build a structured and searchable archive of solved problems

### Structure
Each folder is categorized based on the topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.), and each solution is written in C++.

### Why I'm Doing This
I aim to improve my algorithmic thinking, which is essential for cracking placement interviews and building a solid foundation for system-level programming. Although my primary interest lies in cybersecurity, I recognize that DSA is a crucial skill for getting shortlisted and performing well in technical evaluations.

### Notes
- Problems are sourced from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Striver's A2Z Sheet.
- All solutions are written with clarity and efficiency in mind.
